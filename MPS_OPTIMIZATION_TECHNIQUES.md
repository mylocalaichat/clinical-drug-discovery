# MPS Optimization Techniques for PyTorch Geometric

## Overview

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) GPUs use **MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)** backend in PyTorch. However, PyTorch Geometric has compatibility issues with MPS due to missing operator support.

This document explains techniques to effectively use MPS with GNN training.

## Key Challenges with MPS + PyTorch Geometric

### Problems:
1. **Sampling operations not supported** on MPS (e.g., `NeighborLoader` sampling)
2. **Sparse operations** have limited MPS support
3. **Memory management** is different from CUDA
4. **Some scatter/gather ops** not implemented for MPS

### Symptoms:
```
RuntimeError: "scatter_add_" not implemented for 'MPS'
RuntimeError: MPS does not support sparse operations
```

## Solution 1: CPU Sampling + MPS Training

**Key Idea**: Sample subgraphs on CPU, then move batches to MPS for training.

### Implementation:

```python
# Keep data on CPU for sampling
data_cpu = data.to('cpu')

# Create NeighborLoader on CPU
train_loader = HGTLoader(
    data_cpu,
    num_samples={...},
    batch_size=512,
    shuffle=True
)

# Model on MPS
model = model.to('mps')

# Training loop
for batch in train_loader:
    batch = batch.to('mps')  # Move mini-batch to MPS
    output = model(batch.x_dict, batch.edge_index_dict)
    # ... compute loss, backprop
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Sampling works (done on CPU)
- ✅ Training accelerated (done on MPS)
- ✅ Memory efficient (only batch on MPS, not full graph)

---

## Solution 2: Mini-Batch Training

**Key Idea**: Train on small batches instead of full graph.

### Why it helps:
- Reduces peak memory usage
- Fits larger graphs on MPS
- Enables gradient accumulation

### Configuration:

```python
batch_size = 512          # Nodes per batch
num_neighbors = [10, 5]   # Sample 10 neighbors for layer 1, 5 for layer 2
```

**Example**: For 100K nodes, instead of loading all 100K:
- Batch 1: 512 nodes + their sampled neighbors (~5K nodes)
- Batch 2: Next 512 nodes + neighbors
- ...

This keeps MPS memory usage low and stable.

---

## Solution 3: Gradient Accumulation

**Key Idea**: Accumulate gradients over multiple batches before updating weights.

### Why it helps:
- Larger effective batch size without memory overhead
- Stabilizes training
- Equivalent to training with `batch_size * accumulation_steps`

### Implementation:

```python
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4

optimizer.zero_grad()
for i, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
    loss = compute_loss(batch) / gradient_accumulation_steps
    loss.backward()

    # Update every N batches
    if (i + 1) % gradient_accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

**Example**: With `batch_size=512` and `accumulation_steps=4`:
- Effective batch size = 512 * 4 = 2048
- Memory usage = 512 nodes
- Best of both worlds!

---

## Solution 4: Layer-Wise Computation

**Key Idea**: Compute GNN layers sequentially, clearing intermediate results.

### Why it helps:
- Reduces memory spikes
- Only stores current layer's activations
- MPS has limited memory compared to CUDA

### Implementation:

```python
for conv in self.convs:
    x_dict = conv(x_dict, edge_index_dict)
    x_dict = {key: F.relu(x) for key, x in x_dict.items()}

    # Clear cache after each layer
    if torch.mps.is_available():
        torch.mps.empty_cache()
```

---

## Solution 5: Aggressive Memory Management

**Key Idea**: Explicitly clear MPS cache frequently.

### Why MPS is different:
- CUDA: Automatic memory management
- MPS: More manual management needed

### Implementation:

```python
# After each batch
if device == 'mps' and hasattr(torch.mps, 'empty_cache'):
    torch.mps.empty_cache()

# After each epoch
del embeddings  # Delete tensors
torch.mps.empty_cache()
```

---

## Solution 6: Neighbor Sampling Strategy

**Key Idea**: Sample fewer neighbors per layer to reduce subgraph size.

### Comparison:

**Full-batch (doesn't work on MPS for large graphs):**
```python
# All 100K nodes + 8M edges loaded to MPS
→ Out of memory!
```

**With sampling:**
```python
num_neighbors = [10, 5]  # Layer 1: 10, Layer 2: 5

# Batch of 512 nodes:
# - Layer 1: 512 * 10 = 5,120 neighbors
# - Layer 2: 5,120 * 5 = 25,600 neighbors
# Total ~31K nodes in memory (vs 100K)
→ Fits on MPS!
```

### Tuning:
- **More neighbors**: Better accuracy, more memory
- **Fewer neighbors**: Less memory, faster training
- Recommended: `[10, 5]` for 2 layers, `[10, 10, 5]` for 3 layers

## MPS-Optimized HGT Pipeline

### Full Configuration:

```python
from clinical_drug_discovery.lib.gnn_hgt_mps_optimized import (
    generate_hgt_embeddings_mps_optimized
)

stats = generate_hgt_embeddings_mps_optimized(
    edges_csv="data/01_raw/primekg/kg.csv",
    output_csv="data/06_models/embeddings/hgt_embeddings.csv",

    # Model architecture
    embedding_dim=512,
    hidden_dim=256,
    num_layers=2,
    num_heads=8,

    # MPS optimization parameters
    batch_size=512,                    # Nodes per batch
    num_neighbors=[10, 5],             # Neighbor sampling
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,     # Accumulate gradients

    # Training
    num_epochs=100,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    device='mps',                      # Use MPS

    # Contrastive learning
    contrastive_weight=0.5,
    similarity_threshold=0.1
)
```

## Performance Comparison

### Full-Batch (Original):
```
Graph: 100K nodes, 8M edges
Memory: ~16GB VRAM needed
Status: ❌ Out of memory on MPS (16GB M1)
Fallback: CPU only (slow)
```

### Mini-Batch + Sampling (Optimized):
```
Graph: 100K nodes, 8M edges
Batch: 512 nodes, ~31K nodes in subgraph
Memory: ~2GB VRAM per batch
Status: ✅ Runs on MPS (16GB M1)
Speed: ~10x faster than CPU
```

---

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use MPS-Optimized (Mini-Batch):
- ✅ Large graphs (>50K nodes)
- ✅ Limited VRAM (8-16GB M1/M2)
- ✅ Training embeddings from scratch
- ✅ Need faster training than CPU

### Use Full-Batch (Simple):
- ✅ Small graphs (<10K nodes)
- ✅ High VRAM available (>32GB)
- ✅ Maximum accuracy (all neighbors)
- ✅ Inference only (not training)

---

## Memory Budget Estimation

### Rule of Thumb:

```
VRAM needed ≈ batch_size * avg_degree * num_layers * embedding_dim * 4 bytes
```

### Example:
```
batch_size = 512
avg_degree = 50 (after sampling)
num_layers = 2
embedding_dim = 512
→ 512 * 50 * 2 * 512 * 4 = ~50MB per batch (safe!)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "MPS backend out of memory"
**Solution**:
- Reduce `batch_size` (512 → 256)
- Reduce `num_neighbors` ([10, 5] → [5, 3])
- Increase `gradient_accumulation_steps`

### Issue: "scatter_add_ not implemented for MPS"
**Solution**:
- Keep data on CPU for sampling
- Use `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`

### Issue: Training very slow on MPS
**Solution**:
- Check batch size (too small = overhead)
- Ensure batches moved to MPS (`batch.to('mps')`)
- Clear MPS cache frequently

### Issue: Accuracy lower than full-batch
**Solution**:
- Increase `num_neighbors` (sample more)
- Increase `num_epochs`
- Use larger `batch_size`
- Tune `gradient_accumulation_steps`
