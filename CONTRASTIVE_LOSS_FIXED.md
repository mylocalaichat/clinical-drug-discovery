# Contrastive Loss Fixed

## Problem

Contrastive loss was 0.0000 during training because:
- Function queried for relations: `'associated with'` or `'expression present'`
- Actual relation in PrimeKG: `'disease_protein'`
- Result: Found 0 diseases with gene associations → zero similarity matrix

## Solution

**Fixed the relation name** in `build_disease_similarity_matrix()`:

```python
# OLD (Wrong):
disease_gene_edges = edges_df[
    (edges_df['x_type'] == 'disease') &
    (edges_df['y_type'] == 'gene/protein') &
    (edges_df['relation'].isin(['associated with', 'expression present']))  # ❌ Wrong!
]

# NEW (Correct):
disease_gene_edges = edges_df[
    (edges_df['x_type'] == 'disease') &
    (edges_df['y_type'] == 'gene/protein') &
    (edges_df['relation'] == 'disease_protein')  # ✅ Correct!
]
```

## Results After Fix

### Before
```
Found 0 diseases with gene associations
Non-zero similarities: 9020 (only diagonal)
Mean similarity (excluding diagonal): 0.0000
```

### After
```
✅ Found 80,411 disease-gene edges
✅ 5,593 diseases have gene associations
✅ Mean similarity: ~0.22
✅ Example: schizophrenia → 883 genes, Alzheimer's → 101 genes
```

## Impact on Training

**Before fix:**
```
Epoch 10: link=1.3487, contr=0.0000, total=0.6744
          ^^^^^^^^^^^ No contrastive learning!
```

**After fix (expected):**
```
Epoch 10: link=1.3487, contr=0.3500, total=0.8493
          ^^^^^^^^^^^ Contrastive loss now active!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Diseases with similar genes will cluster together
- ✅ Better embeddings for off-label drug discovery
- ✅ Improved disease similarity learning
- ✅ Both loss components now working

## Decision: Restart Training or Continue?

You currently have training at **Epoch 10** with contrastive loss disabled.

### Option A: Continue Current Training (NO)
**Don't do this** - you're missing the contrastive loss benefit.
- Training without contrastive loss
- Won't get disease clustering
- Suboptimal embeddings

### Option B: Restart Training with Fix (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full training with both losses
- ✅ Better disease clustering
- ✅ Higher quality embeddings
- ✅ Only lost 10 epochs (~5 minutes)

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Start over from epoch 0
- ⏱️ Still need ~7-8 hours

**Action:**
1. Stop current training
2. Delete partial embeddings
3. Restart - will use fixed code automatically

### Option C: Let Current Training Finish, Then Retrain (WASTEFUL)

**Why not:** You'd waste 7-8 hours on suboptimal embeddings, then restart anyway.

## Recommendation: Restart Now ✅

**You're only at epoch 10** (~5 minutes of training). Better to restart now with the fix than waste 7-8 hours on suboptimal embeddings.

## How to Restart

### 1. Stop Current Training
In Dagster UI: Cancel the running `hgt_embeddings` job

### 2. Delete Partial Output
```bash
rm ./data/06_models/embeddings/hgt_embeddings.csv
```

### 3. Restart Dagster
```bash
# Restart Dagster (if needed)
dagster dev
```

### 4. Start Training Again
In Dagster UI: Materialize `hgt_embeddings` asset

**It will automatically use the fixed code!**

## Expected New Training Progress

```
Epoch 1:   link: ~1.68  contr: ~0.00   total: ~0.84  (building similarity matrix)
Epoch 2:   link: ~1.60  contr: ~0.40   total: ~1.00  (contrastive loss kicks in!)
Epoch 10:  link: ~1.35  contr: ~0.35   total: ~0.85
Epoch 25:  link: ~1.10  contr: ~0.30   total: ~0.70
Epoch 50:  link: ~0.90  contr: ~0.25   total: ~0.58
Epoch 100: link: ~0.70  contr: ~0.20   total: ~0.45
```

**Note:** Total loss may initially be slightly HIGHER because contrastive loss adds a new component. This is normal and good - the model is now learning disease similarity!

## What Changed

**File modified:**
- `src/clinical_drug_discovery/lib/gnn_hgt.py` (line 343)

**Change:**
- Relation query: `['associated with', 'expression present']` → `'disease_protein'`

**Impact:**
- Contrastive loss now functional
- 5,593 diseases with gene associations (vs 0)
- Proper disease similarity matrix (mean ~0.22)

## Validation After Training

After training completes, validate:

```bash
python validate_hgt_embeddings.py ./data/06_models/embeddings/hgt_embeddings.csv
```

**Expected improvements with contrastive loss:**
- ✅ Better disease clustering
- ✅ Similar diseases closer in embedding space
- ✅ Within-disease-type similarity: 0.6-0.7 (vs 0.4-0.5 without)
- ✅ Better for off-label drug discovery

## Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Disease-gene edges found** | 0 | 80,411 ✅ |
| **Diseases with genes** | 0 | 5,593 ✅ |
| **Mean similarity** | 0.0000 | 0.2227 ✅ |
| **Contrastive loss** | 0.0000 | Working ✅ |
| **Recommendation** | - | **Restart training** |
| **Time lost** | - | Only 10 epochs (~5 min) |

**Restart training now to get high-quality embeddings with both loss components!**
