## Implementation Recommendation

### Approach: Two-Tier Filtering

#### Tier 1: Essential Nodes (Always Include)
```python
ESSENTIAL_TYPES = [
    'drug',           # 7,957
    'disease',        # 17,080
    'gene/protein',   # 27,671
    'effect/phenotype', # 15,311
    'pathway'         # 2,516
]
# Total: 70,535 nodes (54.5%)
```

#### Tier 2: Contextual Nodes (Filter/Aggregate)
```python
CONTEXTUAL_TYPES = {
    'biological_process': {
        'strategy': 'filter_top_level',  # Keep only parent processes
        'threshold': 1000,  # Keep top 1000 most connected
    },
    'molecular_function': {
        'strategy': 'aggregate_by_class',  # Group by enzyme class
        'classes': ['kinase', 'receptor', 'transporter', 'enzyme']
    },
    'anatomy': {
        'strategy': 'aggregate_by_system',  # Organ systems only
        'systems': ['cardiovascular', 'nervous', 'respiratory', etc.]
    }
}
```

#### Tier 3: Excluded Nodes
```python
EXCLUDED_TYPES = [
    'cellular_component',  # Too granular
    'exposure'             # Environmental, not therapeutic
]
# Excluded: 4,994 nodes (3.9%)
```

## Updated GNN Implementation

### Current Implementation (loads ALL)
```python
node_query = """
MATCH (n:Node)
RETURN n.node_id as id, n.node_name as name, n.node_type as type
"""
```

### Recommended Implementation (filtered)
```python
node_query = """
MATCH (n:Node)
WHERE n.node_type IN ['drug', 'disease', 'gene/protein', 'effect/phenotype',
                       'pathway', 'biological_process', 'molecular_function', 'anatomy']
RETURN n.node_id as id, n.node_name as name, n.node_type as type
"""
```

This excludes:
- cellular_component (4,176 nodes)
- exposure (818 nodes)
- **Total excluded**: 4,994 nodes (3.9%)
- **Total included**: 124,381 nodes (96.1%)

## Rationale by Use Case

### For Drug Repurposing
**Priority**: drug ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > disease ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > gene/protein ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > pathway ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > effect/phenotype ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### For Side Effect Prediction
**Priority**: drug ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > effect/phenotype ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > gene/protein ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > pathway ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > anatomy ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### For Target Identification
**Priority**: gene/protein ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > drug ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > disease ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > molecular_function ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê > pathway ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Tier 2 filtering** in `gnn_embeddings.py`
2. **Compare embeddings** with/without filtered nodes
3. **Evaluate XGBoost performance** on filtered vs full graph
4. **Consider hierarchical aggregation** for GO terms (biological_process, molecular_function)
5. **Monitor embedding quality** via visualization (PCA, t-SNE)

---

## Performance Impact

### Current (All 10 types)
- Nodes: 129,375
- Training time: ~15-20 min (MPS)
- Embedding memory: ~250 MB

### Recommended (8 types, exclude 2)
- Nodes: 124,381 (96.1%)
- Training time: ~14-19 min (MPS) - **marginal improvement**
- Embedding memory: ~240 MB - **marginal improvement**

### Core Only (5 types)
- Nodes: 70,535 (54.5%)
- Training time: ~8-10 min (MPS) - **50% faster**
- Embedding memory: ~135 MB - **46% reduction**

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation**: Use **Option 2 (Extended)** - Include 8 out of 10 node types, excluding:
- ‚ùå cellular_component (too granular, cell biology)
- ‚ùå exposure (environmental, not therapeutic)

This provides the best balance of:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive drug discovery context
- ‚úÖ Mechanistic understanding
- ‚úÖ Minimal noise
- ‚úÖ 96.1% of nodes retained
- ‚úÖ Only 3.9% excluded

For **faster experimentation**, start with **Option 1 (Core Only)** - 5 essential types.
